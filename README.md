# Args-Engine
Args-Engine is a data oriented C++17 OpenGL game engine built to make optimal use of modern hardware.<br>
Its core is built on an async compute minded design to take care of the logic and an ECS to take care of the data. This allows the Arg engine and editor to utilize all the power it can find and to be extremely modular.
